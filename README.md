# Welcome to The Alphabytes repository

### What will I find here?
This repo is home to The Alphabytes' revolutionary application for simple IBS relief through an easy to use low FODMAP food tracker, **FODfinder**.

### What is the FODfinder?
>For people suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome who want to conveniently determine if the foods they are choosing to buy or consume will impact them negatively, the FODfinder website is a web-based application that will allow users to explore foods, both generic and from well-known name brands, and determine whether they are suitable for their diet. Using a proprietary algorithm, foods will be automatically ranked from low to high FODMAP content based on their ingredients, which are checked against a database containing hundreds of ingredients from well-established sources. In addition, registered users will be able to input additional ingredients that they've found to be problematic in their experience. For extra convenience, a mobile android application will also be integrated so that users can scan barcodes in store and get a quick score for foods they're unsure about. Unlike other nutritional databases, our product will specialize in just one dietary need, as opposed to other sites that cast a wide net and provide marginal support for several diets.
